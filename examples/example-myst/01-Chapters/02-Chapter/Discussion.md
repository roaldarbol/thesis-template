In this chapter I present a method for classifying behavioural states across multiple timescales simultaneously, by applying multiple reverse filters with user-defined time parameters. Using two timescales I show that descriptions of active/passive behaviour is highly sensitive to the timescale chosen. Next, I describe how the hierarchical relationship between timescales affect estimates of time spent in a particular behaviour as well as transitions between them.

<!-- This raises important questions about whether stationary states can be meaningfully subdivided into discrete states, or whether it is a continuum. -->

## Implications for inferring internal states
Behavioural classification is often used... to relate some physiological measure. 

### Metabolic rate
Determining active and passive metabolic rates in freely moving animals rely on the ability to partition the behaviour into active and passive behaviour. This work could greatly benefit this sort of work... distinguish between metabolic rates... 

### Brain states


## Critique of time as a proxy for sleep
Thresholding is a procedure that makes presumptions. It assumes that... A low threshold will thus increase the number of Type I errors, whereas a high threshold will increase Type II errors. What needs to be recognised is that the fundamental assumption that sleep occurs after a pre-determined amount of time of immobility is flawed; the same amount of rigour that is employed

As sleep research has entered the mainstream, and high-throughput methods has allowed vast numbers of individuals, the individual has been lost. Rather than.., we average across time series.

## Limitations
The hierarchical thresholding is an improvement over a single threshold. However, it is not perfect. Improvements could be including postural information, along with environmental information, such as where the animal places itself along an environmental gradient.

Using a 3-state HMM to differentiate further between...
