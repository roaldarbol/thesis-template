## Organisation of behaviour
A central aim of modern neuroscience is to understand how neural signalling gives rise to behaviour. However, researchers disagree about what behaviour *is*. The realisation that the organisation of behaviour was a fundamental problem was apparent since the early days of ethology. Already in 1942, Tinbergen hypothesised about the hierarchical organisation of behaviour. The central idea is that not all behaviour is equal, but some types of behaviour are dependent on higher level behaviours, e.g. that male aggression and mating display towards females are both part of a higher behavioural level, "mating". Dawkins1976 further expanded on this idea, and introduced a discrimination between different types of hierarchical organisation. He distinguished between hierarchies o... Neuroscientists have only recently and sparingly picked up on these ideas. Pirger2014 identified a neuronal mechanism for a hierarchical organisation of behavioural choices in snails (species name). 

Across time scales.

In a key study Kaplan2020 found a nested hierarchical organisation of movements in *C. elegans*, and further showed that this hierarchical organisation was reflected in the neural activity that produced it.



**Use of behavioural states in behavioural ecology, usually with tagging, trackers**.

The use of centroid tracking is now widely used for long-term monitoring of animals at high temporal resolution [French2021]. 

## Non-behaviour, immobility and sleep
Animals spend a large portion of their life moving around their environment, yet most animals spend a large portion of time being stationary. Most of the the work on this ... yet it is also well known that there are stationary behaviours, such as thanatosis, freezing, the stealth of an ambush predator (not to mention the possibility that animals are capable of wakefully doing nothing). Statistical properties of stationary periods in the ground beetle *Nebria brevicollis*. 



Here, we quantify the stationary. Stationarity is not the absence of behaviour, rather it is a collection of behaviours that differ primarily in their aim(/scope). However, these aims are unknown to us, so we have have to rely on proxies that we *can* measure. Here we attempt to create a framework to.
To remain agnostic about the stationary states, we work with a non-model species, the ground beetle *Nebria brevicollis*.  about which little is known either behaviourally (and nothing is known about its neural processing). 

Activity/rest patterns. The assumption here is that when an animal is not locomoting, it is *resting* [Bartholomew1985; Brown2006; Fujioka2019; Tobler1983]. Yet 

Activity patterns are used widely in circadian rhythm and sleep research.

## Effect of environmental stimuli on states
Light at night may have different effects...

Activity patterns have been determined only indirectly by trapping frequency by pitfall traps [Williams1959; Luff1978] at two-hour intervals. Thus nothing is known about the activity patterns of individual beetles.

Using HMM to determine REM/non-rem/wake, and the effects of light phase.

## Research questions
- Is stationary behaviour scale-invariant?
- (Are differences at short timescales better explained by longer time scales?)
- What time scale makes the best predictions about what will happen in the next (x time)? Does having multiple time scales improve predictions?
- Does experimental conditions affect higher or lower hierarchical states?
