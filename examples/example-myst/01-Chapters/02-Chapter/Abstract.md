What do people need to know to understand and appreciate the research:
- Behaviour is ill-defined
- Non-behaviour has received little attention
- Behaviour is hierarchical
- Temporal clustering suggests persistent states
- Behaviour is affected by external stimuli (environmental stimuli)
- Novel tracking methods empower us to look closer

What is unknown that we are explore:
- Unknown whether circadian rhythms affect the fast or slow components
- Unknown whether external stimuli affect fast or slow components
