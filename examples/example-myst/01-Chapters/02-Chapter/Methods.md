## Animals
*Nebria brevicollis*, a species of ground beetle common in the United Kingdom, were collected in temperate forest around University of Sussex (50°51'48.8"N, 0°05'10.9"W) in autumn 2021. We used pitfall traps to capture the beetles. They were maintained in an incubator on a 12h light:12h darkness cycle at 11° /6° C respectively. Beetles were housed individually in 10 (L) × 7.5 (W) × 4.5 (H) cm plastic containers with soil or peat, regularly sprayed with water to ensure a humid environment and fed one mealworm (*Tenebrio molitor*) pupae per week. For experiments, beetles were handled under red light.
% The light cycle was shifted 12 hours, so the beetles experiences subjective day during the night, and subjective night during the day. We will just use \textit{day} as \textit{subjective day} hereafter. 

## Experiments
Beetles were recorded throughout a 24 hour period. Three different light conditions were used: Light/darkness (LD) in which the well plate and beetles were illuminated with white light for approximately 6 hours, followed by 12 hours darkness and a further 6 hours of illumination with white light; 24 hours of continuous illumination by white light (LL); or, 24 hours of continuous darkness (DD). Each animal experienced all conditions twice with 2 weeks between trials.
