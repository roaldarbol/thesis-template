## Behavioural states, brain states and beyond
A term that has found grace in both ethology and neuroscience is *state*. Behavioural states, brain states, internal states. They have very different origins... Behavioural state seems to have be used in the classical Tinbergen sense, to allow researchers to classify behaviour, even if animals were doing seemingly unrelated actions throughout an otherwise robust behavioural sequence, a term known as (find in his book). However, with recent advances in computer vision and computing power, behavioural state has taken on a new meaning. With the ability to track specific body-parts, known as pose estimation, behavioural state is becoming influenced by concepts from dynamical systems and state space.
